## Smart-Monitor  (In Production - live)

### Motivation for Developing Smart-Monitor

In many production environments I have worked in, whether in **Site Reliability**, **DevOps**, or **Platform Engineering** 
roles, I have seen the same recurring pattern. Monitoring tools like **Prometheus** or **Grafana** provide excellent
visibility, but they don’t actively *do* anything to fix issues in real time. This often leaves engineers in reactive
mode, receiving alerts at **3 AM** for problems that could have been resolved automatically.

**Smart-Monitor** was created to close that gap.

### Why Smart-Monitor?
- **Move from awareness to action**: Traditional monitoring alerts humans, but doesn’t remediate. Smart-Monitor automates recovery.
- **Reduce Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: Automatic fixes for common failures mean less downtime and fewer escalations.
- **Proactive operations**: Detect issues early and apply solutions before they impact users.

### Core Goals
1. **Real-time Metrics Collection**  
   Monitor CPU, memory, disk, network, and service status continuously.

2. **Automated Recovery Logic**  
   - Restart failed services.
   - Kill runaway processes under memory pressure.
   - Apply remediation for network connectivity failures.

3. **Modular Architecture**  
   Separate modules for metrics, network, disk, and service recovery.  
   Each can be developed, tested, and extended independently.

4. **Extensibility**  
   Easily add new checks and recovery actions without disrupting existing logic.

### Design Philosophy
> **Monitoring is not enough.**  
> Systems should not just *observe* failures, they should attempt to *recover* from them automatically when safe to do so.

By embedding recovery logic directly into the monitoring tool, Smart-Monitor reduces reliance on manual intervention,
keeps systems running longer without human input, and ensures faster problem resolution.

### Impact
- **Fewer late-night alerts** for engineers.
- **Improved system resilience** through automated remediation.
- **Lower operational overhead** with self-healing capabilities.
