What ngrok actually does:
Think of ngrok as a reverse proxy as a service.
    -It runs a small client (containers) that connects out to ngrok’s cloud.
    -ngrok then gives a public URL (https://xyz.ngrok.io) that tunnels traffic back into the local app.

So you don’t need:
    -to open firewall ports
    -to configure ISP router
    -to buy a public IP

ngrok free plan offers:
    -Public HTTPS URL → great for demoing services (like sqlite-web, Grafana, Prometheus).
    -Temporary subdomain (random-string.ngrok.io).
    -Basic web UI (http://127.0.0.1:4040) to inspect traffic.
    -Up to 1 tunnel, 1 ngrok process.

Install ngrok
On Windows host (since smart-monitor.service is exposed on localhost:9080):
    -Download from https://ngrok.com/download
    -Unzip, place ngrok.exe somewhere in sys PATH (e.g. C:\Windows\System32 or C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\).
    -Or use Chocolatey:
        choco install ngrok -y
    -Note:
        For the most secure experience, use the Microsoft Store to install ngrok. This type of installation is fully
        supported by Windows, ensuring automatic updates and compatibility with app management tools.

Authenticate (one-time)
Create an ngrok account (free). Copy authtoken from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
    -Then run on powershell or cmd:
        -ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_AUTHTOKEN>

Start a tunnel to sqlite-web
    -Since sqlite-web is already reachable on the Windows host at http://127.0.0.1:9080:
        -ngrok http 9080

Copy the public URL
    -ngrok will output something like:
    -Forwarding  https://abcd-1234.eu.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:9080
    -Open the https://...ngrok.io URL in a browser or share it anyone with the link can reach your sqlite-web UI.

Security warning:
    -sqlite-web has no login by default, so anyone with the URL can browse/modify the DB.

If a need to share safely, use:
    -ngrok http --basic-auth user:pass 9080
    -this prompts for a username/password
    -but thi does not guarantee that the user cannot modify db
    -thats the reason db path was mounted in the container with option :ro
